-------------------------------- 
              NOTE!
-------------------------------- 
ELUAR decrypts the encrypted usernames when 
preforming the credentials match, this could
be a potential security flaw for motivated 
enough attackers. this program is not ment
for big corpirations or tech giants and is only
ment for personal use. I the creator will in no
way be held responsible just because i am too 
lazy to fix this. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, all users
are allowed to distribute at will but may not lay 
claim to this completed program cause i worked hard 
on it... so please have mercy.

PS. idk why there would be a risk though unless you 
angered someone you shouldn't have messed with XD
